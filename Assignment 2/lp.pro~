%Number 1
sum-up-numbers-simple([],0).        %This is base case for empty list.
sum-up-numbers-simple(L, N) :-      %This takes in parameters.
   [X|Y] = L,                       %This breaks the list into first and tail.
   sum-up-numbers-simple(Y, Sum),   %This sum the tail of the list to sum.
   number(X),                       %This checks to ensure X is a number to.
   N is X + Sum.                    %If true it adds X to the rest of the sum for tail.
sum-up-numbers-simple(L, N) :-      %This block handles a nested list.
   [X|Y] = L,
   sum-up-numbers-simple(Y, Sum),
   is_list(X),                      %At this step is where it checks that it is a list.
   N is 0 + Sum.                    %And if true it adds zero to sum.
sum-up-numbers-simple(L, N) :-      %This block deals with a none number charater.
   [X|Y] = L,
   sum-up-numbers-simple(Y, Sum),
   not(number(X)),                  %At this point it is evaluted.
   N is 0 + Sum.                    %And if true zero is added.
